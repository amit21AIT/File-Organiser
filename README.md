# File-Organiser
Created a file organiser using Apache Camel which polls a particular directory provided by the user and all the files of same filetype(Images , videos, pdf etc.) are kept in the same folder which makes it easy for the user to find the required files of a particular type.

# The files are organised into following types :-
                      Images
                      Videos
                      Music
                      Codes
                      Compressed Files
                      Powerpoint Presentations
                      Word Files
                      PDF Files
                      Excel Files
                      Other Files (If the file does not match any of the above category it is stored in Other Files).
